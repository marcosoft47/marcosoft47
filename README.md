## About Me
Hi There! I'm marcosoft47, aka Mark. I'm Computer Science undergrad, in UDESC CCT. I'm particularly interested in computer vision and backend development.

I'm also an open source enthusiast. I was the technical leader of the [Colmeia](https://github.com/ColmeiaUDESC) group. Colmeia is all about open source, and it aims to introduce people of all ages to the open source culture. I was a Python and Arduino teacher. My main project in Colmeia is the [Kinect Livre](https://github.com/ColmeiaUDESC/Kinect-Livre) project. The Kinect Livre project searchs for ways to reuse the Microsoft Kinect camera in open source projects, mainly using the [OpenKinect](https://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page)'s tools. Most of my time in Colmeia was researching and implementing Augmented Reality Sandboxes ([SARndbox](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/)) in schools. I also made some projects and documentation of the OpenKinect's Freenect for Python, you can find it in [my repository](https://github.com/marcosoft47/freenect-python).

During my time in Colmeia, I also tried some computer vision. I did some projects with OpenCV and Mediapipe. You can find some of my computer vision projects in my [computer vision repository](https://github.com/marcosoft47/computer-vision).

As an open source enthusiast, of course I also use Linux. Played with Ubuntu, Debian and Arch for a while, stayed in Fedora. Sometimes I also go to tech congress, like [Latinoware](https://latinoware.org/) and [Codecon Summit](https://codecon.dev/summit).
