## About Me
I'm marcosoft47, also known as Marco, or Mark, and I'm Computer Science student, in UDESC CCT. I'm particularly interested in backend development and computer vision.

I'm also an open source enthusiast. I am the technical leader of the [Colmeia](https://github.com/ColmeiaUDESC) group. Colmeia is all about open source, and it aims to introduce people of all ages to the open source culture. I was a Python and Arduino teacher. My main project in Colmeia is the [Kinect Livre](https://github.com/ColmeiaUDESC/Kinect-Livre) project. The Kinect Livre project searchs for ways to reuse the Microsoft Kinect camera in open source projects, mainly using the [OpenKinect](https://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page)'s tools. Most of my time in Colmeia was researching and implementing Augmented Reality Sandboxes ([SARndbox](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/)) in schools. I also made some projects and documentation of the OpenKinect's Freenect for Python, you can find it in [my repository](https://github.com/marcosoft47/freenect-python).

During my time in Colmeia, I also tried some computer vision. I did some projects with OpenCV and Mediapipe. You can find some of my computer vision projects in my [computer vision repository](https://github.com/marcosoft47/computer-vision).

As an open source enthusiast, of course I also use Linux. Played with Ubuntu, Debian and Arch for a while, stayed in Fedora. Sometimes I also go to tech congress, like [Latinoware](https://latinoware.org/) and [Codecon Summit](https://codecon.dev/summit).
